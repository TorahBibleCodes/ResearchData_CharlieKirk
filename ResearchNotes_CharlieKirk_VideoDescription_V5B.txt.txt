The Hebrew term (ירו בו) "[They] shot him" is past tense.

Within Numbers chapter 11, we see two (2) ELS matches for this term.

	1. ELS match with skip distance (d) of every +22 letters.
	2. ELS match with skip distance (d) of every +72 letters.

For 2D Matrices, the laws of Cartesian 2D Algebra apply, including the formula:

	y = mx + b

Therefore, other than edge-case exceptions on either right or left side of the 2D Matrix helix, counting (extapolating) letters in any of the 8 directions is an equidistant letter sequence:  A column-width (x) of any integer number, e.g. 20 or 9, or 10, 18, 27, 30, 33, etc., allows one to potentially find ELSs visually in any linear direction:

	1.) Up
	2.) Down
	3.) Right
	4.) Left
	5.) Diagonally Up Right
	6.) Diagonally Down Right
	7.) Diagonally Up Left
	8.) Diagonally Down Left

Remember: for 2D Matrices, the laws of Cartesian 2D Algebra apply, including the formula:

	y = mx + b
	
By extrapolating this Hebrew term "Yaru bo" (ירו בו) "[They] shot him" in both directions, we can observe visually, as well as confirm mathematically, that a feasible, longer phrase message exists in this extrapolated "skip distance (d)-string":

HEBREW PHRASE: (יער בוש כשיירו בו יען)

ENGLISH TRANSLATION: "[He] will awaken a shame when [they] will shoot him; [he] will answer."

ALT. ENGLISH TRANSLATION #1: "[He] will awaken a shame when [they] will shoot him - because [of this]."

ALT. ENGLISH TRANSLATION #2: "A forest of shame, when [they] will shoot him, [he] will answer."

ALT. ENGLISH TRANSLATION #3: "A forest of shame, when [they] will shoot him - because [of this]."

The Hebrew term (יירו בו) "[They] will shoot him" is future tense of the same Hebrew term "Yaru bo" (ירו בו) "[They] shot him" in the past tense.

As we can see, the Hebrew letter Yud (י) of the Hebrew term "[He] will awaken // [a] forest" (יער) "Ya'eer // Ya'ar" is separated from the Hebrew letter Ḥet (ח) of the ELS match (רצח) "[he] murdered; a murder" by a skip distance (d) of +22.

Similarly, we can also extrapolate this ELS match (רצח) located at (n,d,k):(206826, -90, 3) to search for longer phrases:

HEBREW PHRASE: (רצחנו)

ENGLISH TRANSLATION: "[We] murdered."
